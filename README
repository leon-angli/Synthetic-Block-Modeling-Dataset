The folders sparse_model1, dense_model1, and model2 contain the test cases used in the Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5, respectively, of the paper above.

Each ".mat" file contains a single test case. It includes two variables "adj_mat" and "GT": (a) "adj_mat" is a adjacency matrix representing the graph of the test case; and (b) "GT" is an array storing the (ground-truth) membership of each vertex of the graph, i.e., GT[v] is the membership of the vertex v.
